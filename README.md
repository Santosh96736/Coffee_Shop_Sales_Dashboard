📌 Project Overview

  I worked on a dataset of a coffee shop’s sales for the first half of 2023. The raw data needed some cleaning, so I used Excel Power Query to remove errors, make it           consistent, and prepare it for analysis. Once the dataset was ready, I imported it into Tableau and built an interactive dashboard.

My goal was simple: create a dashboard that is not only insightful but also easy to read and visually appealing.

## 🔑 Some Interesting Insights

* ☕ Coffee is the top-performing category, followed by Tea

* 🕘 Sales peak between 8–10 AM → strong morning rush

* 📍 Hell’s Kitchen store brings in the most sales

* 📦 Customers prefer Regular (32.7%) and Large (31.9%) sizes

* 💰 Total Sales for 6 months = $699K
  

## ☕ Recommendations

* **Sales peak in the morning (8–10 AM) but drop in the evening** → run evening campaigns or happy-hour offers to boost sales later in the day.

* **Weekends are slower than weekdays** → introduce weekend-only deals like family combos, “Buy 1 Get 1 Free” or special weekend to attract more customers.

* **Small size drinks don’t add much value** → either lower their price or bundle them with snacks to make them more profitable.

* **Average orders per customer are low** → launch a “Couple Plan” (2 drinks + 1 pastry at a special price) to increase order size.
