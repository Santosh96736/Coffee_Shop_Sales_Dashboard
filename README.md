# ☕ Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard | 2023 (Jan–Jun)
📌 Project Overview

I worked on a dataset of a coffee shop’s sales for the first half of 2023. The raw data needed some cleaning, so I used Excel Power Query to remove errors, make it consistent, and prepare it for analysis. Once the dataset was ready, I imported it into Tableau and built an interactive dashboard.

My goal was simple: create a dashboard that is not only insightful but also easy to read and visually appealing.


## 🎯 What I Focused On

* Cleaning and shaping the raw data with Excel Power Query

* Tracking key KPIs like Total Sales, Total Quantity Sold, Average Bill Per Transaction, and Average Order Per Transaction

* Breaking down sales by categories, product types, sizes, and locations

* Finding patterns in time (hours, weekdays, months) to see when customers buy the most

* Keeping the design clean with a consistent coffee-inspired color theme ☕
  

## 🛠️ Tools I Used

* **Excel Power Query** → Data cleaning and preparation

* **Tableau Public** → Dashboard design and visualization
